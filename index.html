        <p>What type of file is my body? My soul? It feels like "uploading" myself to any website or platform is data bending especially on platforms only meant to accommodate and see whiteness. Each upload is a glitch waiting to happen.</p>

      <blockquote cite="http://">
        The Master and Slave narrative is embedded into our hardware. When my self, is translated into pixels, into code, they become part of this framework, one that also seems to mimic the current world as I know it. The perpetual gaze exists regardless of where I turn. If reality is based off our projections, to be uploaded offers the opportunity to be newly projected. This time on a white screen. Continuous disembodied projections. What happens to my body after it is translated. After it is embedded into a system. After I no longer own it. After it is accessible to all. In middle school and high school, I uploaded photos of myself to Facebook, as a way to feel closer to myself and others. It was a ritual to do so, a new album every year. An opportunity to share my life. But this life, was compressed into numbers, and now used for surveillance. Now, the Master wants me to mimic my pixels, pixels taken from images, taken from life. There is no hope in this abstraction. Only room for the Master's Projection. An opportunity for those in power to project, mold, and create whatever reality they desire. A reality, that I somehow, am a part of, even if it is through death.
